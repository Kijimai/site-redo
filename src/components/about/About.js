          Back in 2020 I graduated from San Francisco State University with a
          degree in Fine Art and Animation, but due to the pandemic, I had to
          retrace my steps and reconsider my situation. I had a very

          the process of learning and implementing code. Although I work
          primarily solo on most of my current work, I'm no stranger to group
