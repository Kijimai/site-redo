            I am a frontend focused web developer that enjoys turning beautiful designs into beautiful websites.

            the Projects section. I also like sharing content related to the

            degree in Fine Art and Animation, but due to the pandemic, I had to
            retrace my steps and reconsider my situation. I had a very
            introductory experience to coding many years prior but I never

            group based projects, so if you'd like to work with me... */}
